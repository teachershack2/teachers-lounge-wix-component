## Wix APIs
For this project code we used several of the Wix APIs:

wix-users-backend
 * used to get the user usernames for the preprocessing before data from a form is inserted into the dataabase
 


## Wix editor
This is some of the behind the scenes of what we managed to accomplish with Wix.

On the right hand side of this image is the list of different pages and lightboxes that we created for this project, many of which contain code as seen in the code editor below.

We edited the permissions of the pages so that only memebers can access certain pages such as request creation, and we edit the seo page names for the differnt routes

We created two separate databases. Further explanation of these database can be found in our devpost.

We added some backend preprocessing scripts for updating data in the database.
